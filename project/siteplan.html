    <h1>Horizon School Divison</h1>
    <p>'Horizon' is the name of the school division that the ticketing system is meant for (I work in the IT department of the Horizon School Division). The ticket form and the easy fixes/self help will have instructions that work within the Horizon School Divison, but might not work in other buisinesses.</p>

        <h2>Questions & Scenarios</h2>
        <h3>Do You have problems with any technology within the Horizon School Division, including a computer not turning on, WIFI connection issues or a burned out projector bulb?</h3>
        <h3>Do you need to order new technology for your school?</h3>
        <h3>Do you have sugestions about how we can improve the technology in the division?</h3>

        <br><br>

        <h3>How do I submit a ticket?</h3>
            <p>To submit a ticket, you can use our <a href="">Form Page</a>. It is recommended that you look through our <a href="">Easy Fixes & Instructions</a> page before making a ticket.</p>
        <h3>I made a ticket a few days ago. Why have I not received help?</h3>
            <p>We our very busy and sometimes get a burst of new tickets. Also, tickets at schools that are farther away usually take longer to complete because we have to plan a trip around it and it often takes a whole workday.</p>
        <h3>What simple steps can I try on my own before making a ticket?</h3>
            <p>Read through our <a href="">Easy Fixes & Instructions</a> page to see if there are any instructions for your current technology problem.</p>
